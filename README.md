- It can be used to get efficient cummulative sum queries
- Examples:
  - [303](./303.%20Range%20Sum%20Query%20-%20Immutable/README.md)


## Sliding Window
It consists of using a window to traverse the array and keep track of the sum of the elements in the window.

## Two Pointers
It consists of using two pointers to traverse the array and keep track of the sum of the elements in the window.

## Binary Search
It consists of using a binary search to find the index of the element in the array.
